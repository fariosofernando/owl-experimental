**Project Owl (Experimental)**

A Rust-based tool designed to automate the backup and synchronization of local Git repositories.
It creates a secure clone of the original repository, handles file copy operations while respecting
`.owlignore` patterns, and sets files in the destination directory to read-only to prevent
unauthorized modifications. Ideal for maintaining reliable backups and ensuring local changes are
preserved without conflicts.
